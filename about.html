    <p class="w3-center" style=color:#b3826d>Welcome to Bliss Books, your one stop shop for all your reading needs. Feel free to chill in our gorgous cafe, pick up your next letterary adventure from our wide range of books - old and new. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of reading meterial, along with drinks (both hot and cold) with the finest of treats to enjoy with your read.
    <br><br>
    Newly founded in 2020, Bliss Books has come a long way from its beginnings. When the Founders of Bliss Books first started out, their passions for books and reading drove them to look into reading cafes and book shops in the area, so that Bliss Books can offer you a truly unique and relaxed experience. 
    <br><br>
    We proudly serve customers currently from our cafe and shop (though due to the Covid-19 Pandemic we are currently closed) but we are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website - so while the doors are shut on our physical shop we hope to bring the magic from our home to yours.
    <br><br>
    We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
    <br><br>
    Sincerely,
    <br>
    The Bliss Books Team </p>
